Hello, my name is Ainsley Brennan and I am a third year student at the University of Manitoba. This blog is dedicated to my studies with Dr. Dubois in Women and Religion 1 and Monks, Mystics, and Manuscripts in Medieval Christianity. Thank you for reading. 
My research is best read with a cup of orange pekoe tea with a splash of milk. Bonus points if the mug is sinfully large.
