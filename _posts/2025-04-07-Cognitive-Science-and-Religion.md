title: Belief - Barrett's Basics
--- 


### Welcome


Hello all. Welcome to this edition of Studying with Ainsley. This is my final digital project for RLGN 2116: Cognitive Science and Religion with Dr. Kenneth MacKendrick. 



### What is Belief? 

Imagine that your brain is a toolbox. Equipped with a variety of tools, the possibilities of what you can build with your mind is endless! Your brain has tools for "languages, other tools for processing information through the eyes, and other tools for making sense of other people's behaviours" (3). 

Now, just as your toolbox can build an IKEA dresser, the toolbox of your brain can build _belief_.

According to Justin L. Barrett, "belief is fundamentally a mental process" (2). So, when thinking about the question _Why Would Anyone Believe in God?_ you can replace believing with mentally processing. 

Barrett theorizes that there are two types of beliefs: non-reflective beliefs, and reflective beliefs. 

##### Non-Reflective Beliefs 

Non-reflective beliefs (NRBs) "operate without our awareness" (6). NRBs, or for our purposes, non-reflective mental processes, explain why we expect things to fall when we drop them, or avoid running directly into people in a busy hallway. 

You can think of NRBs as quick, requiring no effort on your behalf, and efficient at helping you function day-to-day. After all, it would be really inconvenient if you had to test whether or not a floor was capable of holding up your weight every time you step into a new room...
