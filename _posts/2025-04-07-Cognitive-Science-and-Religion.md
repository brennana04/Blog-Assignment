title: Belief - Barrett's Basics
--- 


### Welcome


Hello all. Welcome to this edition of Studying with Ainsley ☕️. This is my final digital project for RLGN 2116: Cognitive Science and Religion with Dr. Kenneth MacKendrick. 



## What is Belief? 

Imagine that your brain is a toolbox. Equipped with a variety of tools, the possibilities of what you can build with your mind is endless! Your brain has tools for "languages, other tools for processing information through the eyes, and other tools for making sense of other people's behaviours" (3). 

Now, just as your toolbox can build an IKEA dresser, the toolbox of your brain can build _belief_.

According to Justin L. Barrett, "belief is fundamentally a mental process" (2). So, when thinking about the question _Why Would Anyone Believe in God?_ you can replace believing with mentally processing. 

Barrett theorizes that there are two types of beliefs: non-reflective beliefs, and reflective beliefs. 

##### Non-Reflective Beliefs 

Non-reflective beliefs (NRBs) "operate without our awareness" (6). NRBs, or for our purposes, non-reflective mental processes, explain why we expect things to fall when we drop them, or avoid running directly into people in a busy hallway. 

You can think of NRBs as quick, requiring no effort on your behalf, and efficient at helping you function day-to-day. After all, it would be really inconvenient if you had to test whether or not a floor was capable of holding up your weight every time you step into a new room...


##### Reflective Beliefs 

Reflective beliefs (RBs) are a bit more complicated. These are the mental processes that require us to pause and take a second to think. With reflective beliefs, we can "weigh the pros and cons, examine the evidence for, and then make a decision" (7) regarding whatever content is in front of us. 

It's important to note that just because we have these two different mental processes, doesn't mean that either one is necessarily correct (9). We have incorrect NRBs and RBs all the time. 

## The Recipe for Religion:

According to Barrett, when you mix the three following ingredients together: 
- non-reflective mental processes (beliefs)
- things that are minimally counter-intuitive (MCI)
- and hypersensitive agency detection device (HADD)
  
... you get religion.



##### But How Do We Define Religion? 

Religion, according to Justin Barrett, is more about relation to invisible agents, than anything else (26). So, if the Montréal Canadiens are your religion, sorry, this doesn't apply to you. But gods, angels, demons, superhuman agents, and ghosts...? That's more what Barrett is concerned with. 



## Minimally Counterintuitive (MCI) 
##### ... or things that just don't make total sense 

So we've discussed non-reflective mental processes already, but what are these other strange ingredients? 

Things that are minimally counterintuitive or MCI, are things that are normally pretty basic and simple to understand, like a plant, a running shoe, or an apple tree, but something is slightly off about it (22). 

For example, if the tree spoke, or the shoe could hear you, or the plant starting eating an animal, that would be minimally counter intuitive (22-23). MCI things are not necessarily non-existent, after all, a Venus-flytrap plant is a plant that eats animals (22)!

MCI concepts cause us to stop in our tracks. Why is the tree talking? Trees don't talk... or do they? 

## Hypersensitive Agency Detection Devices (HADD) 
##### ... or why bumps in the night scare us


The final ingredient in the recipe is the hypersensitive agency detection device, or HADD. HADD explains how humans have been able to survive for all these years. HADD is how our ancestors survived, assessing risk by identifying hidden or camouflaged predators/threats, even if sometimes it was just a strong wind in the trees (32). Let us say you are alone in the forest. Maybe you are tired, maybe it is dark. Either way, you spot "an ambiguous thing, such as a wispy form [suddenly your mind assumes it is]... a ghost or spirit" (33). Maybe the best idea is to run away. After all, it's better to be safe than sorry. 

Even if the entity was just a trick or the light, or a hallucination, our fight or flight responses as humans kick in. We detect agency even if there is none, hence "hypersensitive".

## So What Now? 

With Barrett's book _Why Would Anyone Believe in God?_ giving far more details, simply put, the recipe of the tools of non-reflective mental processes/belief, encountering minimally counterintuitive concepts, and the hypersensitive agency detection device seeking out agents, we are left with the perfect blend of tools that produces religion... a belief in supernatural entities. 

Since all of the tools in our toolbox (brain) were with us since birth, it is "the design of our minds that leads us to believe" (124).
