title: The Faith Expression of Hutterite Women
---

### Welcome! 
Hello! Welcome to Studying with Ainsley ☕️, a blog based on my studies at the University of Manitoba in the Department of Religion. For my final project with Dr. Dubois’s Women and Religion 1 class, I wanted to do something very hands on and get to meet with actual religious women, rather than just reading articles online. So, using my connections to the Hutterite community in Manitoba, I set out to interview various Hutterite women with a variety of roles and responsibilities on their colonies. 

### Some Background

For those who are unfamiliar with Hutterites, they are an Anabaptist Protestant Christian group that was birthed out of the teachings of Jakob Hutter in modern day Germany and Austria. The Hutterites lived in Moravia (in modern day Czechia) in the 17th century until they were expelled for their religion. Hutterites live communally, eating together, worshipping together, and working together. Hutterites have found new homes in North America, and there are large Hutterite communities in the three prairie provinces of Canada: Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. The Hutterites are well-known for their skills at farming and their overwhelming generosity. 

### What Did I Think I Would Learn? 
When I first started taking this class with Dr. Dubois, I learned a lot about the idea of a Material Witness based off of a reading by Klassen and Lofton about the mediation of Christianity and its connection to gender. Through this, it is an observed phenomena that women tend to practice their religion and act as role models through physical acts, rather than verbal acts of teaching like males. For lots of women in Christianity, their bodies play a role in their devotion, with people like Catherine of Siena and Marie D’Oignies fasting and putting their bodies through immense physical discomfort as a sign of their devotion to God. I set out to find out in a similar way (though not through asceticism) whether or not Hutterite women’s physical responsibilities were seen as acts of devotion, and see what other connections I could make between gender and religiosity.

### How Did I Accomplish This? 
I reached out to a number of communities and set up meetings with Hutterite women of various colonies. I had conversations with Glenda from James Valley Colony, Sylvia from Grand Colony, Martha from Bon Homme Colony, Elma from Elm River Colony, and Hannah* from Decker Colony. 
(*name has been changed for privacy purposes.)
In these conversations, I asked them a lot about their day-to-day lives, upbringings, schooling, and responsibilities on their colonies. They each had very different responsibilities which allowed me insight from a variety of perspectives.

### What I Did Learn?

In these conversations, I asked them a lot about their day-to-day lives, upbringings, schooling, and responsibilities on their colonies. They each had very different responsibilities which allowed me insight from a variety of perspectives. It’s easy to box people in with the information you can find in a textbook, but I wanted to get a much more personal look, especially since women throughout all histories are underrepresented. I had the idea that the physical outputs of these women’s work would be seen as signs of devotion. Hannah told me,

```A lot of Hutterites might articulate it a different way, as an act of love…an act of worship, like you’re actively worshipping through your daily actions and the ways you interact with people, and your submission to …like you’re literally giving your whole existence to the community```

Hannah is a university student, and is becoming a teacher. Many people seek to enter university to get high-paying jobs, for Hannah though she “might have the aptitude and leave and pursue a career [but she is] choosing to give these gifts that [she has] in service to other people who live in the community”. When I spoke to Elma, who is the principal of the school on Elm River Colony, about how she sees her responsibilities, she told me directly:

```it’s how I express my faith.```

My understanding of the Hutterite ways of life being so steeped in the values of community living has grown. Every woman I talked to mentioned how wonderful the power of teamwork is, and how comforting and fulfilling it is to know one’s efforts are for a greater good of the community. Elma also said:

``` The big part of living on a colony is that everybody’s cared for… from the cradle into the grave, and there is no such thing as poor. Everybody gets exactly what they need…You’re not just here for yourself, you’re here for others in whichever capacity, the community, wherever you’re needed.```

When I spoke to Martha on Bon Homme Colony, her insights into life as a gardener and a pastor’s life. When describing her workload, she mentioned how exhausted she gets from a days work, but that the prayers she does in the morning and the knowledge that everyone is working for the sake of everyone else is a force to keep her motivated. Her husband, Clifford, was in the room while we were speaking and he articulated a point that I myself was concluding as well. Clifford plainly said:

```I find the ladies’ roles on the colonies are the fundamental roles of community life. They do much more of the community building than the men do.```

This really stood out to me especially, as Clifford is the minister of his colony, and is therefore the leader of his community, yet he clearly recognizes and acknowledges the foundation that his community is built on and is able to run on. Through my experience studying religion, it is easy to see the places where women are underrepresented, but knowing that at least on a small scale that the women of the community are respected so deeply and their actions emulated is quite rewarding not only as someone who studies religion, but as a woman myself.
 
Another thing that came up each time was how these women start their days. Without fail, each of the women I spoke to told me how they pray every morning. For Martha, the importance of prayer is as plain as day: 

```My day has started when I have done my prayers. I ask God for guidance and for His support, His strength, His help… it’s my foundation.```

While life has its challenges at the best of times, for Sylvia of Grand Colony, she also is physically disabled, and her daily prayers are a great source of strength for her. Sylvia told me:


```If I don’t pray in the morning, I don’t know how I could handle my muscular dystrophy…It’s the faith in God that keeps me going, you know, it does a big thing for me.```


Sylvia's ability to overcome her disability is a way she is a role model for others. When I arrived at Bon Homme after visiting Grand and mentioned how I was with Sylvia, everybody’s face immediately lit up, showing her influence outside of her colony as well. 
The influence these women have beyond the colony is staggering too. I was so pleased hearing about the various efforts throughout the year that the colonies do for others. Glenda packed up a bunch of kitchen supplies for another colony who had a kitchen fire, and provides lots of extra food for Ukrainian families in need. This spirit of generosity and giving comes from a place of Hutterites having more than they need, which was evident even on a smaller scale. Everywhere I went, I was offered tea and cookies, and even sent home with plates full of Christmas cookies and blocks of cheese. I also came late to lunch at James Valley and was told to make myself at home and help myself to a plate. I did, and as it shouldn’t surprise anybody, was it ever delicious.

### So What Did I Conclude? 

From all of my conversations with these Hutterite ladies, my main conclusion is that because their lives are so entrenched with their religiosity — they start the morning with prayer, they pray throughout the day, they live according to their faith — that therefore, every action they do in their lives are expressions of their faith. The faith expression of Hutterite women is very pronounced in the physical measures of cooking, cleaning, sewing, babysitting, gardening, motherhood, and sisterhood. These roles on the colony are always for the betterment of their community. Christians see Jesus as being their saviour, being all they need in life, being a source of compassion and love from the cradle to the grave. In the same way, you can draw a parallel to life on the colony. From the ‘cradle to the grave’, you are cared for, you have everything you need in life, you are loved. The functioning of the colony as a whole would completely disappear if it were not for the women. Everything they do is so crucial for the day-to-day function and efficiency of the colony. Despite men being the pillars of the community, and the leadership roles on paper, it is the women who are the strong foundation that keep everything upright in the first place, and it is the love of the women powered by the Holy Spirit, that powers the rest of the community. Just as the love of Jesus has emanated into their lives as Hutterites, their actions translated as love emanate into the lives of others.
