## Gold Leaf
In traditional Buddhist countries, there is a heavy emphasis on worship to statues depicting Buddha, often kept in temples called Pagodas. In many of these Pagodas, there are thin sheets of gold leaf that can be purchased to be placed on these statues of the Buddha. These sheets are made by pounding gold into leaves into a fraction of the thickness of a sheet of standard printer paper. Workers wield 15-pound hammers and workers spent their entire working days pounding the gold into these leaves.  The leaves are almost completely pure gold, which is a valuable metal in all parts of the world, and they are used to adorn the Buddha and temples in many Buddhist countries because of its beauty and rareness.

## Use 
 At many of these temples, there are opportunities to place sheets of gold onto depictions of Buddha, which is seen as a great way to make good karma or merit. The only skill you would then need is the ability to physically place the leaf onto the statues, which themselves are often already covered in leaves from devotees across the years. This is demonstrated well in the image above, as the original Buddha shape is barely perceivable from the layers of gold. As for the senses, there is physical touch required in using the gold leaf to gild these statues, as well as the sense of sight in order to admire the radiance that the gold gives off once placed among the rest. In many temples, there are no restrictions on who can participate in the gilding, but not all temples are fair in that way.

## Connection to Gender
In the Maharani Temple in Burma, there is a massive statue of Buddha that has been covered in gold leaf throughout the years, outside of the area where the statue resides, there is a sign that says, in Burmese and English “Ladies are not allowed to enter”. In most parts of the world, the systems are very patriarchal, and in Buddhism, there is historical and scriptural context that supports a patriarchal system. The exclusion of women from this opportunity to make good karma and therefore have a better shot at a future life when reincarnated is just one way that the patriarchy exudes its power over women.
